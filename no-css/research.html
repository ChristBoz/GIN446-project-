    <summary>Is HTML 5.2 the latest HTML version?</summary>
   <p> After HTML 5.2, HTML 5.3 was proposed but it was never finalized. The goal of HTML 5.3 was to introduce small enhancements and clarifications to the HTML5 specification. On December 14, 2017, the W3C released a working draft of HTML 5.3. The purpose of this draft was to improve upon current features and fix problems found in HTML 5.2 W3C. The Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG) and the W3C agreed in May 2019 to stop developing distinct W3C versions of HTML, such as HTML 5.3 and DOM 4.1. Rather, they chose to concentrate on the WHATWG's "HTML Living Standard," which is updated and maintained by major browser vendors on a regular basis. </p>

    <summary>History of CSS</summary>
   <p>Håkon Wium Lie first proposed CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) in 1994, and he and Bert Bos worked together to develop it under the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Its goal was to enable people to distinguish between presentation (styles: colors, fonts, layout, etc.) and content (HTML), which HTML alone was unable to accomplish effectively. </p>
   <p>December 1996 saw the release of CSS1, the first official version.  Font styling, text properties, color, background, margins, padding, and the box model were among the new features it brought. </p>
   <p>Then came CSS2, which was made available in May 1998 and included support for more sophisticated selectors, media types (screen, print), positioning (absolute, relative), and additional layout control.  Later, CSS2.1 fixed some browser inconsistencies.</p>
   <p>CSS3 was released in the middle of the 2000s; it was divided into modules rather than being a single, comprehensive specification, allowing for the independent development of various features.  Animations, transitions, adaptable layouts, new selectors, and other features were all included in the modules.  It facilitated faster innovation and increased CSS's flexibility.</p>
   <p>More sophisticated CSS features have emerged in recent years, including grid layout, container queries, media queries, flexbox, responsive design, custom properties (variables), etc.  It is constantly changing to assist developers in creating more maintainable and screen-size-adaptable designs.</p>
