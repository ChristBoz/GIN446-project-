                <h2>Evolution of Web Security</h2>
                <p>Since the creation of the Internet, web security has changed significantly.  Websites used to transmit data in plaintext, which left it vulnerable to manipulation and interception.  A significant development was the introduction of the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) in the middle of the 1990s, which offered encryption for data sent over the internet.  Although SSL 1.0 was never made available to the general public, SSL 2.0 and 3.0 were released, providing data encryption while it was in transit.  Later, Transport Layer Security (TLS), which offered better security features and stronger encryption, replaced SSL.[5]
                </p>
                <p>
                   As the need for secure communication increased in the 2000s, HTTPS adoption grew.  To ensure confidentiality, HTTPS encrypts data using the SSL/TLS protocols.  Web site owners were encouraged to switch to HTTPS when numerous major websites started to mark HTTP sites as insecure.

                <h2>OWASP Top Ten Vulnerabilities</h2>
                <p>An awareness document for web application security and developers is the Open Web Application Security Project's (OWASP) Top Ten.  It reflects widespread agreement regarding the most important security threats to web applications.  The most recent edition of the OWASP Top Ten was released in 2021.  The list gives developers a framework to prioritize security measures by mentioning common vulnerabilities like Injection, Cryptographic Failures, and Broken Access Control.[6]

                    Importance of Web Security
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Implementing web security practices is very important for many reasons:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Protection of Sensitive Data:</strong> Makes sure that private and financial information sent online is secure and cannot be intercepted by nefarious parties.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Stopping Cyber Attacks:</strong> Protects apps and websites against a variety of online dangers, such as data breaches and hacking attempts.</li>
                    <li><strong>Maintaining User Trust:</strong> People are more likely to interact with websites that use security indicators, like HTTPS, which show a dedication to data protection.</li>
                    <li><strong>Compliance with Regulations:</strong>  A number of industries must abide by laws that require particular security measures to safeguard user data, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the EU.</li>
                </ul>

  <h2>Common Web Risks for Users</h2>
  <p>
   Phishing is the most frequent danger that users face when using the internet. Criminals send dubious emails or links to websites in an attempt to obtain users' login credentials.  The anti-phishing working group discovered that login or financial systems were a recurring theme among the more than one million phishing attempts that were made globally in 2025.[7]
  </p>
  <p>
    Other threats include malware and ransomware that spreads by clicking on malicious attachments or URLs, Cross-Site scripting attacks that let malicious scripts run in your browser, SQL injection that modifies input fields to gain unauthorized access to databases, and flawed access control that allows unauthorized users to view and alter data.

  <h2>Safe Practices to Protect Yourself</h2>
  <p>
    To reduce your exposure to those threats, here are some safe practices users should follow regularly:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Create strong, one-of-a-kind passwords</strong>: don't use the same one for several websites. To assist with creating and storing complex passwords, use password managers.[8]</li>
    <li><strong>Set up multi-factor authentication (MFA)</strong> Even if your password leaks, it will be much more difficult for hackers to access your account if you have a second form of verification (such as an SMS, email code, authentication app, or hardware token).[8]</li>
    <li><strong>Be wary of links and attachments</strong> check dubious emails before clicking, confirm sender addresses, and stay away from opening attachments from unfamiliar sources.[8]</li>
    <li><strong>Update your software</strong> Frequent updates to operating systems, apps, and browsers guarantee that known vulnerabilities are fixed.[8] </li>
    <li><strong>Make use of VPNs and secure connections</strong>: Use HTTPS websites whenever you can, and encrypt your traffic on public Wi-Fi by using a VPN.[8]</li>
    <li><strong>Restrict the amount of personal information shared</strong>: Be careful what you share online or post on social media. Maintain strict privacy settings and refrain from disclosing more information than is necessary. (OWASP and F5 guidelines support general best practices.)[8] </li>
  </ul>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    Web security is a field that always will evolve over time in response to emerging threats and technological advancements. By knowing and understanding its history and using the best practices, organizations can protect their digital assets and maintain the trust of their users.</p>
