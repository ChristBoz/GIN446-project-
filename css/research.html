        <h2>Is HTML 5.2 the Latest HTML Version?</h2>
        <p>After HTML 5.2, HTML 5.3 was proposed but was never finalized. The goal of HTML 5.3 was to introduce small enhancements and clarifications to the HTML5 specification. On December 14, 2017, the W3C released a working draft of HTML 5.3, aiming to improve upon existing features and fix problems found in HTML 5.2.</p>
        <p>In May 2019, the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG) and the W3C agreed to stop developing distinct W3C versions of HTML, such as HTML 5.3 and DOM 4.1. Instead, they now focus on the <strong>HTML Living Standard</strong>, which is updated and maintained continuously by major browser vendors.</p>

        <h2>History of CSS</h2>
        <p>Håkon Wium Lie first proposed CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) in 1994, and he and Bert Bos developed it under the W3C. Its goal was to separate presentation (styles: colors, fonts, layout) from content (HTML), something HTML alone could not do effectively.</p>
        <p>The first version, <strong>CSS1</strong>, was released in December 1996 and introduced basic styling features like fonts, colors, margins, and padding. <strong>CSS2</strong> followed in 1998, adding positioning, advanced selectors, and media types.</p>
        <p>In the 2000s, <strong>CSS3</strong> arrived, modularized for easier development and faster updates. It added animations, transitions, responsive design, and flexible layouts through features like Flexbox and Grid.</p>
        <p>Today, CSS continues to evolve with modern capabilities such as <em>container queries, variables, and powerful layout systems</em> that make responsive design simpler and more efficient.</p>

        <h2>CSS Rules and How They Work</h2>
        <p>A CSS rule, also known as a ruleset, is a declaration in CSS that instructs the browser on which HTML element or elements should have a particular appearance.</p>
        <p>There are two primary components to a rule:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Selector(s)—which HTML element or elements to focus on</li>
          <li>One or more declarations (property + value) inside { } in a declaration block</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A declaration resembles <code>property: value;</code></p>
        <p>Here's the basic syntax:</p>
        <pre><code>
selector {
  property1: value1;
  property2: value2;
  /* …more declarations… */
}
        </code></pre>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <pre><code>
p {
  color: blue;
  font-size: 16px;
}
        </code></pre>
        <p>Since <code>p</code> is the selector, all paragraphs are targeted. The declarations <code>color: blue;</code> and <code>font-size: 16px;</code> form the full ruleset.</p>
        <p>Commas can also be used to separate different selectors:</p>
        <pre><code>
h1, h2, .special {
  margin-top: 20px;
}
        </code></pre>
        <p>This applies <code>margin-top: 20px</code> to any element with class <code>special</code>.</p>
        <h3>The "cascade" and specificity of CSS rule application</h3>
        <p>There is a reason CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets: an element may occasionally be subject to more than one rule. CSS uses a system of specificity to determine which rule "wins."</p>
        <h4>Particulars</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>ID selectors (like <code>#myId</code>) are more specific than class selectors (like <code>.myClass</code>).</li>
          <li>Class selectors are more specific than type selectors (like <code>p</code>, <code>div</code>).</li>
          <li>Browsers assign weights to selectors to determine which rule applies.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Cascade and source order</h4>
        <p>The rule that appears later in the CSS (or "closer" to the element) wins if two rules have the same level of specificity. The "cascading" behavior includes this..</p>
        <h4>Relevance / !important</h4>
        <p>By appending <code>!important</code>, you can make a declaration take precedence over others! crucial to it (although this is frequently discouraged as it can make CSS more difficult to maintain).</p>
        <h4>Inheritance</h4>
        <p>Child elements inherit certain CSS properties from their parent. If you set <code>color: green;</code> on <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>, for instance, many text elements inside will take on that color unless they are overridden. However, not every property is inherited.</p>

        <h2>History of JavaScript</h2>
        <p>In 1995, Brendan Eich developed JavaScript while being at Netscape Communications Corporation. At first it was called Mocha then LiveScript and in December 1995 it became JavaScript. Part of the reason for the name change was to capitalize on the then-current popularity of the Java programming language. JavaScript lets developers carry out tasks like form validation, basic animations and other user interactions right within the browser. It was created to make web pages more interactive.</p>
        <p>The ECMAScript standard was created in 1996 after JavaScript was submitted to ECMA International for standardization.  The 1997 release of ECMAScript 1 was followed by the 1998 release of ECMAScript 2, which primarily contained minor editorial revisions.  A major turning point was reached in 1999 with the release of ECMAScript 3, which included features like regular expressions, enhanced string handling, and try/catch exception handling.  Dynamic HTML (DHTML), which combined HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to enable more dynamic and animated web pages, appeared around the same time.</p>
        <p>Modern and responsive web applications were made possible by the 2005 release of AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML), which enabled web pages to update content dynamically without requiring a complete page reload. The release of ECMAScript 5 (ES5) in 2009 brought getters/setters, JSON support, and strict mode. After ECMAScript 6 (ES6/ES2015) was released in 2015, JavaScript's functionality and readability were significantly increased by adding significant features like arrow functions, template literals, classes, and modules.</p>
        <p>Every year since 2016, ECMAScript has been updated with new features to improve the language.  JavaScript is now even more flexible for creating web applications, server-side applications, and even mobile apps thanks to innovations like async/await, shared memory, and sophisticated built-in objects.  JavaScript is still one of the most popular programming languages in use today, supporting interactive websites and serving as the foundation for a vast number of contemporary applications.</p>
