        <h2>Digital Landscape and Internet Usage in Lebanon (2025)</h2>
        <p>
          Recently, Lebanon has seen a huge increase in the number of Internet users. 
          As of early 2025, there were 5.34 million internet users which is around 91.6% of the country's population, 
          and around 4.68 million people used cellular data which is roughly 80.4% of the population, 
          but some of these connections may not fully be internet access and can simply cover voice or SMS. [12]
        </p>
        <p>
          In January 2025, Lebanon also had around 4.02 million social media users, which is around 68.9% of the population. [12]
        </p>
        <p>
          When it comes to speed, there is a pretty big performance difference between mobile and fixed connections. 
          The median mobile internet download speeds stood at about 30.20 Mbps, while the fixed broadband connections averaged 12.78 Mbps. [12]

        <h2>Internet Statistics in the Middle East</h2>
        <p>
          The Middle East has seen a rapid growth of internet users throughout the years. 
          It went from having barely any users to very high in a short amount of time, 
          with several countries achieving near-universal internet penetration. [13]
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>United Arab Emirates:</strong> Around 11.1 million individuals use the internet, which is around 99% of the population.</li>
          <li><strong>Saudi Arabia:</strong> Around 33.9 million people use the Internet, about 99% of the population.</li>
          <li><strong>Qatar:</strong> Around 3.05 million citizens are online, which is 99% of the population.</li>
          <li><strong>Jordan:</strong> Around 10.7 million individuals use the Internet, which is 92.5% of the population.</li>
          <li><strong>Iran:</strong> 73.2 million people use the Internet, which is 79.6% of the population.</li>
          <li><strong>Yemen:</strong> Around 7.29 million individuals use the Internet despite challenges, which is only 17.7% of the country's population.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          These statistics show how countries are working hard to increase Internet accessibility. 
          But even when some achieve near-total connectivity, others still struggle to expand access.
